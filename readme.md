# Basic face recognition project

`python3.7` `face_recognition`

**face_recognition Docs** - https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


This script should recognize faces.

The `known` folder, contains all of the faces that may be recognized, in case you want to add another one, just save the
image over there, with the person name. 

The `unknown` folder, should contain the image of the person you want to try to recognize, the image should be saved as image.jpg (You can of course change it in the code, its pretty modular)

In the near future I will add the option to make it learn to register new faces.
